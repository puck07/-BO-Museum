        <h1> NXT Museum </h1>
    <p>
        The home of new media art. 
        Discover large scale, 
        multi-sensory exhibitions which challenge assumptions and open minds. 
        We seek, show and question what is Nxt.

    <h2> History </h2>
    <p>
        The Nxt Museum in Amsterdam is an innovative museum that takes visitors on a unique experience where art,
        technology and science come together.
        We exhibit works of art that use modern technologies of the present and the future.
        The Nxt Museum offers a fascinating and contemporary look at the role of technology in the art world.
    </p>
    <h2>What is there to see</h2>
    <p>
        From September 27, it is possible to admire the creations of the post-digital artist group Random International in the Nxt Museum.
        The exhibition reveals both recently completed works of art and pieces that have never previously been exhibited in Europe.
        In addition, it provides an insight into the creative trajectory of the artists, from 2006 to the current date.

    <h1> Reviews </h1>

    <h2> Roos </h2>

    <p>
        A beautiful exhibition with new media.
        Suitable for all ages.
        We went with a group of students from the upper secondary school.
        Attention is held.
        Lots of interaction between the viewer and the art through lights and movement.
        Impressive projections and interesting topics.
        Highly recommended!
        (duration: If you walk quickly you can get through it in half an hour.
        If you take it all in, it could take you an hour.)
    </p>



    <h2> Naomi Toure</h2>

    <p> 
        A special and interactive way to experience a museum.
        The living room is a truly wonderful experience.
        You'll be amazed at what is possible with digital art.
        I will definitely go again!
    </p>


    <h2> Jose Angel Gonzalez </h2>

    <p> 
        We expected interactive and creative tech exhibits.
        There's only one room I enjoy.
        Not worth the money.
